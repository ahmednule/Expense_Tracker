# Integrating Frontend and Backend Components of the Expense Tracker Application

## Description:
In this week, you will integrate the frontend and backend components of the Expense Tracker Application using Node.js for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. You will implement user authentication on the backend and create API endpoints to retrieve and display data on the frontend. This will provide hands-on experience with full-stack development, integrating frontend with backend APIs, and managing user sessions securely.

## Requirements:

### User Authentication and Authorization:
        Implement user authentication on the backend.
        Create API endpoints for user login and registration.
        Use sessions or cookies to manage user sessions securely.

### API Integration on Frontend:
        Implement API calls using JavaScript (e.g., Fetch API) to communicate with the backend.
        Configure API endpoints for retrieving and displaying user-specific data (e.g., transactions, budget settings).
        Use HTML and CSS to design UI components for displaying data fetched from the backend.

### User Interface Design and Navigation:
        Design user-friendly UI components/pages for the Expense Tracker Application using HTML and CSS.
        Implement navigation between different pages/components (e.g., login page, dashboard, expense history) using JavaScript.

### Error Handling and Validation:
        Implement error handling mechanisms on both frontend and backend to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
        Validate user input on the frontend to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities.
